    I am a senior student at a university in zhongshan city,my major is a computer science.and i come from shanwei,a city
is located in the esat of GuangDong province. you know i have been living in there for more 20 years,
well, since i was born.
    shanwei  city is a smally costal city ,compared with motrololies like guangzhou and beijing,
but it's developing fast now.since it is close sea,people living there can enjoy the great sea view every day. the life peac there is peaceful,
without much life pressure
    well i have a great interest in computer,because i think learning how to program and design website is turely fun, Another reason is that 
it is more likely to find a good job in the furture, coz as you know ,people without living computer and computer talents will  certainlly be in great demand.
